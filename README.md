# Go-To-Plugin
CKEditor goto plugin for navigating to headers within the editor.

Makes a dropdown menu with all the h1, h2, h3 names, and clicking them navigates the iframe to their location by assigning an id to each header and appending it to the src attribute.  This is non-intrusive and the ids will disappear from the html on save/reload.

Requires jquery and richcombo menus to work.
